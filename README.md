Attempting to create an extension of a "Hello World" programme in Assembler 6502 by trying to create a text display system more programmatically.
At the moment the programme has very basic text printing functionality. A user can write simple words to screen without punctuation
using the standard letters of the English alphabet.

The current programme can be accessed via the following GitHub page: https://sebastianctgtbaop.github.io/6502js/

If the above simulator does not work, the following work-around may be employed:
1. Open https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/simulator.html
2. Overwrite code in the simulator window by copying and pasting code from the hello_world_extension_raw_code file in this repository.
3. Click Assemble and everything should run.

Lacking features (potential additions for a later date):
1. Programmatic "Set New Line".
2. Punctuation.

Many thanks to Nick Morgan for creating the simulator I am currently using. A link to fork this simulator can be found here:
