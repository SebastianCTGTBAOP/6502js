Attempting to create an extension of a "Hello World" programme by trying to create a text display system more programmatically.
At the moment the programme is incomplete, because I have to resolve a problem with 16-bit addressing for pixel display, because
beyond particular characters do not display at all. 

The current programme can be accessed via the following GitHub page: https://sebastianctgtbaop.github.io/6502js/

Many thanks to Nick Morgan for creating the simulator I am currently using. A link to fork this simulator can be found here:
